Test Plan of the security implementation in aip

Test 2: Login attempt w/ missing username and/or password
The API returned FORBIDDEN response with a message of "Bad credentials".

Test 3: Login attempt w/ wrong username and/or password (i.e. {"username": "root", "password": "pass"})
The API returned FORBIDDEN response with a message of "Bad credentials".

Test 4: Login attempt w/ other data types(i.e. {"username": 0, "password": 134657.34})
The API returned FORBIDDEN response with a message of "Bad credentials".
 
Test 5: Login attempt w/ empty JSON String (i.e. {})
The API returned FORBIDDEN response with a message of "Bad credentials".

Test 6: Login attempt w/ empty Request Body

Test 7: Login attempt by calling GET, PUT or DELETE method at "/login"

Test 8: Token validity
Using the JWT returned by the API as params (i.e. adding "?token=xxxxx" after the URL), all functionalities in "/array" and "/nqueens" are accessible for 120 seconds. After the token expired the SAPI gave out empty response and no data (e.g. the integer array in memory) was modified after token expiration.

Test 9: Access non-valid paths with valid token
The API returned NOT_FOUND response.

Test 10: Access attempt using expired Token
The API returned FORBIDDEN response with a message of "Access Denied".

Test 11: Access attempt using invalid Token (e.g. Bad username and/or bad signing key)
The API returned FORBIDDEN response with a message of "Access Denied".

Test 12: Access attempt without Token
The API returned FORBIDDEN response with a message of "Access Denied".
