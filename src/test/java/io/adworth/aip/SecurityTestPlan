Test Plan of the security implementation in aip
	
Test 1: Normal login
By passing a JSON containing {"username": "root", "password": "toor"} to the path"/login", the API sucessfully returned a JWT containing the correct login name "root" and signing key valid for 120 seconds. 
	
Test 2: Login attempt w/ missing username and/or password
The API gave empty response when "username" and/or "password" is an empty string. (i.e. {"username": "", "password": ""})

Test 3: Login attempt w/ wrong username and/or password
The API gave empty response with incorrect "username" and "password" pair. (i.e. {"username": "root", "password": "pass"})

Test 4: Login attempt w/ other data types
The API gave empty response when "username" or "password" contains non-String values. (i.e. {"username": 0, "password": 134657.34})
 
Test 5: Login attempt w/ empty JSON String
The API gave empty response when a user tries to access the API by passing an empty JSON String. (i.e. {})
 
Test 6: Token validity
Using the JWT returned by the API as params (i.e. adding "?Token=xxxxx" after the URL), all functionalities in "/array" and "/nqueens" are accessible for 120 seconds. After the token expired the SAPI gave out empty response and no data (e.g. the integer array in memory) was modified after token expiration.
 
Test 7: Access attempt using expired Token
API will give empty response when a user tries to access the API by  passing an expired token.
